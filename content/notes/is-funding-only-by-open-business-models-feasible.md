Could we fund most of the open information we need via open business models?

Ans: probably not (see arguments in book).

However, what about information industries which are highly cumulative and incremental like software? Here, maybe it is more feasible -- the small cost improvements will be covered by a small "first-mover" advantage or surpluses from selling complementary goods. cf my research, Danny Quah paper etc
